<h3 align="center">HealthTools.KE - theStar Health</h3>

<p align="center">HealthTools is a suite of data-driven web and SMS-based tools that help citizens check everything from medicine prices and hospital services, to whether their doctor is a quack or not. The toolkit was pioneered in Kenya, and has since also been deployed in Ghana, Nigeria, and South Africa.</p>
